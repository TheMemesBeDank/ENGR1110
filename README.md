# ENGR1110

Class taken in Fall 2023 at Auburn University.

Using this repository as a place to store what our final project was. Our group decided on global warming as an overarching topic to explore. 

We found a few datasets that showed CO2 emissions from fossil fuels per year as well as average surface temp in each country. In our project, we wrote Python code that utilized the matplotlib and pandas libraries to help parse this data. We dynamically created graphs that showed the trends of both datasets, as well as a third graph that showed the change in CO2 emissions compared to the previous year.

## Introduction to Engineering

ENGR 1110 Introduction to Engineering is required of all engineering majors. 
The course provides an introduction to engineering design, engineering teams, technical writing, oral presentation, and engineering ethics. 
The Software Engineering sections do this specifically in the context of software development.

By the end of this course, students will demonstrate an ability to:

- Apply engineering design to implement and evaluate computing-based solutions to problems
- Communicate effectively in a professional context
- Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering and computing practice
- Function effectively on a team
- Recognize the importance of cultural intelligence in a professional context
